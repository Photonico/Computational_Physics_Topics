# Scientific Philosophy Excerpts

## Nature Science

* It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong! (Richard Feynman, Cornell University, 1964)

* Many students enter physics with the impression that it is just a lot of mathematical calculations. Calculations are a part of physics, but they are not the most important part. The most important part of physics is the part that deals with phenomena. Most of physics comes from phenomena. Phenomena are the roots of physics. (Robert R. Wilson, Experiments and the Future of Physics, 1978)

* Anybody who wants to do good physics, should be constantly paying attention to physical phenomena, and not the symbols that stand for physical objects. (R.Shankar, Yale Opencourse on Fundamentals of Physics, 2010)

## Mathematics

* Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things. (Henri Poincaré, Science and Hypothesis, 1902)

## Social Science

* I believe that democracy is the best guarantor for peace and for the ultimate peaceful resolution of differences. I believe that it is far better to have a system of government in which dissent is permitted than to have one in which all the apparatus of the state is brought to bear to enforce conformity. I believe that even the worst democracy is better than the best dictatorship, and that the only solution to the problems of the Middle East is to encourage the evolution of democratic institutions. (Al Gore, Earth in the Balance, 1992)

* believe that people with mental illness and intellectual disability do not deserve the right to survive. Once such a standard exists, someday anyone could fall under it. - (X.Luo, CUPL)
